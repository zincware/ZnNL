        Parameters
        ----------

                Order to which the difference should be raised.
        reduce_operation : str (default = "mean")

        Call the distance metric.

        Distance between points in the point_1 tensor will be computed between those in
        the point_2 tensor element-wise. Therefore, we will have:

                point_1[i] - point_2[i] for all i.

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_1 : np.ndarray (n_points, point_dimension)
            First set of points in the comparison.
        point_2 : np.ndarray (n_points, point_dimension)
            Second set of points in the comparison.
        kwargs
                Miscellaneous keyword arguments for the specific metric.

        Returns
        -------
        d(point_1, point_2) : np.ndarray : shape=(n_points, 1)
                Array of distances for each point.
